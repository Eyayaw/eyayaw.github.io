The results show that the housing supply is, on average, inelastic, with a floorspace elasticity of 0.22 and a units elasticity of 0.25. The study also reveals that geographical constraints partially affect the housing supply elasticity across districts. Notably, high development intensity decreases the elasticity, while the unavailability of land for development due to restrictive geography has no significant impact on the housing supply elasticity. The housing supply elasticity estimates may prove useful for calibrating quantitative urban models in Germany."

My research focuses on urban and regional economics, particularly housing market issues. Additionally, I am highly interested in data science with R and Python.\n\n\nShort bio\n\nI grew up in a small village called Shumshuha [ሹምሹሃ] (aka Lalibela Airport) about 10km southwest of the historic town Lalibela, Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nShumshuha — Lalibela Airport, photo © Raimund Stehmann, Airliners\n\n\nI went to Bahir Dar University for my undergrad, for my master’s to KDI School in South Korea, and to Budapest, Regensburg and Trento for a joint European master in comparative local development (Master CoDe).\nFor more than three years, I worked for Jimma University, department of Economics, where I taught undergrad economics courses.\nNow, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Duisburg-Essen."
