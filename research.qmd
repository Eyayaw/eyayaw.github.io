    > **Abstract**
    >
    > The study estimates the housing supply elasticity and the impact
    > of geographic constraints in Germany from 2008-2019 using the
    > Bartik instrument. The results show that the housing supply is, on
    > average, inelastic, with a floorspace elasticity of 0.22 and a
    > units elasticity of 0.25. The study also reveals that geographical
    > constraints partially affect the housing supply elasticity across
    > districts. Notably, high development intensity decreases the
    > elasticity, while the unavailability of land for development due
    > to restrictive geography has no significant impact on the housing
    > supply elasticity. The housing supply elasticity estimates may
    > prove useful for calibrating quantitative urban or regional models
    > in Germany.
