I grew up in a small village called Shumshuha \[ሹምሹሃ\] (aka Lalibela Airport) about 10km southwest of the historic town [Lalibela, Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalibela).

I went to Bahir Dar University for my undergrad, for master's to [KDI School](https://www.kdischool.ac.kr/) in South Korea, and to Budapest, Regensburg, and Trento for a joint European master in comparative local development ([Master CoDe](https://www.unitn.it/ateneo/813/joint-european-master-of-local-development-code)).

For more than three years, I worked for Jimma University, [department of Economics](https://ju.edu.et/college-of-business-and-conomics/), where I taught undergrad economics courses.

Now, I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de/en/index.php).
