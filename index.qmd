# Hi there, welcome!

My name is Eyayaw Beze, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of
Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de/en/index.php). My research
focuses on urban and regional economics, particularly housing market
issues. Additionally, I am highly interested in data science with `R`
and `Python`.

<summary>Short bio</summary>

I grew up in a small village called Shumshuha \[ሹምሹሃ\] (aka Lalibela
Airport) about 10km southwest of the historic town [Lalibela,
Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalibela).

I went to Bahir Dar University for my undergrad, for my master's to [KDI
School](https://www.kdischool.ac.kr/) in South Korea, and to Budapest,
Regensburg and Trento for a joint European master in comparative local
development ([Master
CoDe](https://www.unitn.it/ateneo/813/joint-european-master-of-local-development-code)).

For more than three years, I worked for Jimma University, [department of
Economics](https://ju.edu.et/college-of-business-and-conomics/), where I
taught undergrad economics courses.

Now, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of
Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de/en/index.php).
